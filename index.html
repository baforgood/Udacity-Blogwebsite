                <h2>Be surprised. Be shocked. Be amused.</h2>
                <p>Okay, so what is this all about? I want to take a critical look at my own profession and 
                    what I am doing in my every day life. This happens by telling you stories from my experiences 
                    as a consultant and team lead in data related projects. But why? I want you to get a feeling for what it 
                    really feels like to be in our profession, jumping from project to project and subsequent assignment. 
                    Sometimes it is ridiculous and not funny at all. Sometimes it feels all smooth and good and fun, while 
                    the bad surprise is waiting for you around the next corner. Too dark? Nah, I love my job. It gives me the opportunity
                    to work with talented people on achieving complex goals and improving things in the world of work a bit during these days.
